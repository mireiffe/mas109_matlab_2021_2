# Chapter 6. Linear Transformations

## 6.1 Matrices as Transformations

### Exercise 6.1. (*Linear Transformation: Rotation*)

Make a function file with a function name `reflect_pt` to find the reflection of the point $$(a,b)$$ about the line through the origin of the $$xy$$-plane that makes an angle of $$\theta\,^{\circ}$$ with the positive $$x$$-axis. Make $$a$$, $$b$$, and $$\theta$$ the inputs to the function and the reflection point $$(x,y)$$ the output. Using this function, find the result of this function for $$(a,b)=(1,3)$$ and $$\theta=12$$ by the following commands:

```matlab
>> [x, y]=reflect_pt(1, 3, 12)
```

---

*Solution.*
```matlab
%--- The following is the function file 'reflect_pt.m'. ---%
function [x, y]=reflect_pt(a, b, ang)
theta=ang*(pi/180);
T = [cos(2*theta) sin(2*theta); sin(2*theta) -cos(2*theta)];
   
result=T*[a b]';
x=result(1); y=result(2);
end
```

*MATLAB results.*
```
x =

    2.1338


y =

   -2.3339

```

### Exercise 6.2. (*Linear Transformation: Projection*)

Consider successive rotations of $$\mathbb{R}^{3}$$ by an angle $$\theta_{1}$$ degree about the $$x$$-axis, then by an angle $$\theta_{2}$$ degree about the $$y$$-axis, and then by an angle $$\theta_{3}$$ degree about the $$z$$-axis. Make a function file named `comp_Rot` to find an appropriate axis and angle of rotation that achieves the same result in one rotation. Make $$\theta_{1}, \theta_{2},$$ and $$\theta_{3}$$ degrees the inputs to the function and the axis and angle of rotation the outputs. Give the output axis as a unit vector. You may make the standard matrix for the composition of the rotations by multiplication of the standard matrices for the rotations about the position $$x$$-, $$y$$-, and $$z$$-axes, respectively. Using the function `comp_Rot`, check the result of the following commands:

```matlab
>> [L, ang]=comp_Rot(45, 45, 45)
```

---

*Solution.*
```matlab
%--- The following is the function file 'comp_Rot.m'. ---%
function [L, ang] = comp_Rot(ang1, ang2, ang3)

% Angle as a degree.
angle=[ang1 ang2 ang3];

% Convert angles from degrees to radians.
theta=angle*(pi/180); 

% Rotation about x-axis, y-axis, and z-axis.
Rx = [1 0 0; 
      0 cos(theta(1)) -sin(theta(1)); 
      0 sin(theta(1)) cos(theta(1))];
Ry = [cos(theta(2)) 0 sin(theta(2)); 
      0 1 0; 
      -sin(theta(2)) 0 cos(theta(2))];
Rz = [cos(theta(3)) -sin(theta(3)) 0; 
      sin(theta(3)) cos(theta(3)) 0; 
      0 0 1];

% Composition of the three rotation matrices R = Ry*Rx*Rz.
R = Rz*Ry*Rx; 

% Find the axis of rotation of R,
% by finding the eigenvector of R 
% corresponding to the eigenvalue lambda=1.

% Find a nonzero vector satisfying Rx = x.
L = null(eye(3) - R);

% Make the axis of rotation unit vector. 
L = L/norm(L);  

% Find the angle of rotation of R.
% Note that w=(-x2,x1,0) is 
% orthogonal to the axis of rotation x=(x1,x2,x3).
w = [-L(2) L(1) 0]';
rot_theta = acos((dot(w, R*w))/((norm(w)*norm(R*w))));
ang = ((rot_theta)*(180/pi));
end
```

*MATLAB results.*
```
L =

    0.3574
    0.8629
    0.3574


ang =

   64.7368

```

## 6.2 Geometry of Linear Operators

### Exercise 6.3. (*Rotation as an Orthogonal Transformation*)

Let

$$
A =
\begin{bmatrix}
-\frac{3}{7} & -\frac{2}{7} & -\frac{6}{7}\\
\frac{6}{7} & -\frac{3}{7} & -\frac{2}{7}\\
-\frac{2}{7} & -\frac{6}{7} & \frac{3}{7}
\end{bmatrix}.
$$

Show that $$A$$ represents a rotation, and use Formulas $$(16)$$ and $$(17)$$ in Section $$6.2$$ to find the axis and angle of rotation.

*Solution.*
```matlab
A = [-3/7 -2/7 -6/7; 6/7 -3/7 -2/7; -2/7 -6/7 3/7]; format short;

% Check that A*A' is the identity matrix.
disp('A*A^T = '); disp(A*A')

% Although the off diagonal entries are not exactly all zeros,
% the scaling factor suggests that roundoff error prevents
% the computed matrix from being the identity matrix.
% You can see that the product is exactly the identity matrix,
% when the symbolic computation is used.

% Check that det(A)=1 to conclude that A is orthogonal.
disp('det(A) = '); disp(det(A))

% Since A*A'=I and det(A) = 1, A represents a rotation.

% By (16) of Section 6.2,
% find the angle of rotation 
% and convert the angle from radians to degrees.
theta = acos((trace(A)-1)/2); ang = ((theta)*(180/pi));
disp('The angle of rotation in degrees is'); disp(ang);

% By (17) of Section 6.2, find the axis of rotation.
% The initial point at the origin.
e1 = [1 0 0]'; 

% v is along the axis of rotation.
v = (A+A'+((1-trace(A))*eye(3))) * e1; 
disp('The axis of rotation passes through the point'); disp(v');
```

*MATLAB results.*
```
A*A^T = 
    1.0000    0.0000    0.0000
    0.0000    1.0000    0.0000
    0.0000    0.0000    1.0000

det(A) = 
    1.0000

The angle of rotation in degrees is
  135.5847

The axis of rotation passes through the point
    0.5714    0.5714   -1.1429
